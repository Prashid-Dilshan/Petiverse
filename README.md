# Petivers

" The pet care web application called Petiverse provides an interface between the owners of pets and service providers like vets and daycare centers, right up to administration. It integrates various features that include a secured login system, personal profile views for users, a web shop of pet products, appointment settings at a veterinarian's office, daycare services, health tracking, among others. On top of these, community-driven features provided in the form of discussion forums, blogs, and lost-and-found sections further enable the interlinking among themselves. It also involves special interfaces for vets, administrators, and moderators for smooth management of the platform. "
